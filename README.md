Some facts about me, Georg Korger!
I was born in November 1966 in Vienna/Austria
After finishing a tech engineering school in vienna i started working at ORF, the Austrian Broadcasting Cooparation.
One of my greatest hobbies is coding and exploring code and build systems and experimenting with them.
I am interested in small details and so i love to work with small embedded systems like avr, esp32.
I like to go to the roots, so i like avr_gcc and esp32_idf more than for example Arduino
